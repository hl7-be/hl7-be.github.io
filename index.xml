  <h3>Scope</h3>
	<p>
    This is the DRAFT FHIR specification for Belgium. This document is being developed and may not be used for any implementation or testing purpose.
  </p>
<blockquote class="stu-note">

<strong>This documentation and set of artefacts are still undergoing development, and they are NOT to be taken by implementations.</strong>
The working groups of HL7 and the different interested parties are still defining the process, the requirements and the tooling. This is a placeholder or sandbox for content, and not any recommendation or preview, so there is no guarantee of completeness or correctness.

This specification contains: 
	<ul>
    <li><a href="http://fhir.ivlab.ilabt.imec.be/be-fhir/artifacts.html#logical-models">Logical Models</a>, which describe describing several data sets and elements used in Belgian systems</li>
    <li><a href="http://fhir.ivlab.ilabt.imec.be/be-fhir/artifacts.html#terminology">Value Sets and code systems</a>, containing specific Belgian value sets</li>
    <li><a href="http://fhir.ivlab.ilabt.imec.be/be-fhir/artifacts.html#core-profiles">Core profiles</a>, which constitute the basis for Belgium FHIR profiling and can be reused in other profiles </li>
    <li>Functional Profiles, split by functional area for ease of access</li>
	<ul>
    <li><a href="http://fhir.ivlab.ilabt.imec.be/be-fhir/artifacts.html#communication">Care coordination and Communication</a>, </li>
    <li><a href="http://fhir.ivlab.ilabt.imec.be/be-fhir/artifacts.html#communication">Patient conditions</a></li>
	</ul>
    <li>Required <a href="http://fhir.ivlab.ilabt.imec.be/be-fhir/artifacts.html#logical-models">Capability Statements</a> for systems to implement</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
    The implementation guide is structured to allow implementers to pick and choose the capabilities they need and combine them as necessary.

	<h3>Navigation</h3>
	<p>
    This implementation guide follows the FHIR pattern of being published as a web-based specification.  This
    allows easy navigation between the Belgium-specific portion of the implementation guide and the resources,
    data types, value sets and other specification components leveraged from the FHIR core specification.  This
    approach also allows implementers to easily navigate to the information needed to perform a task.
  </p>
	<p>
    A <a href="toc.html">Table of Contents</a> page is provided that lists all of the pages defined as part of this implementation guide.  (Do be aware 
    that some pages have multiple tabs.)  A table of contents is also available for the full <a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}toc.html">FHIR specification</a> 
    if you really want to read absolutely everything.  There's also an <a href="artifacts.html">Artifact index</a> that lists all formal FHIR artifacts 
    defined within this implementation guide.  The <i>Support</i> menu provides links to the HL7 standards used by this implementation guide as well as
    providing a <a href="downloads.html">downloads</a> link to retrieve a local copy of this implementation guide and/or particular subsets of it.
  </p>
	<p>
    Bread-crumb navigation is provided in the gray bar just below the menu at the top of each page, allowing
    easy navigation back to the main page.
  </p>

	<h3>Intellectual Property Considerations</h3>
	<p>
    While this implementation guide and the underlying FHIR are licensed as public domain, this guide includes examples making use of terminologies such 
    as LOINC, SNOMED CT and others which have more restrictive licensing requirements. Implementers should make themselves familiar with licensing and 
    any other constraints of terminologies, questionnaires, and other components used as part of their implementation process. In some cases, 
    licensing requirements may limit the systems that data captured using certain questionnaires may be shared with.
